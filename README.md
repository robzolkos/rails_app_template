# Rails App Starter

This is a starter Rails project that is setup with the basics of most apps that I write.

It is personalised for me.

* Ruby 2.5.1
* Rails 5.2
* TailwindCSS
* Turbolinks
* jQuery
* PostgreSQL

## How to use

1.  Clone the repo, then `cd` into the project folder
2.  `rm -rf .git` - this clears the git config/history
3.  `git init` - start a new git history
4.  `cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml` - fill in with your details
5.  `bundle install`
